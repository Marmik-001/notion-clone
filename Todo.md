Understood! Let’s refocus on **deep, foundational learning** to build live cursors and collaborative editing **from scratch** without relying on pre-built libraries like Liveblocks or Y.js. This path will prioritize **understanding core concepts** and **implementing them yourself**, even if it takes longer.

---

### **🚀 Phase 1: Learn the Fundamentals (2–3 Weeks)**

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in Next.js and real-time communication.

#### **Week 1: Next.js Architecture**

- **Learn:**
  - Client vs. Server Components (`"use client"`).
  - API Routes (to create a WebSocket server).
  - Dynamic routing (e.g., `/document/[id]`).
- **Build:**
  - A simple document page with a URL like `/document/123`.
  - Use `useState` and `useEffect` to sync data between clients.

#### **Week 2–3: WebSocket Fundamentals**

- **Learn:**
  - **WebSocket API** (raw WebSocket connections).
  - **Socket.io** (simpler abstraction over WebSockets).
  - Create a **WebSocket server** inside Next.js API routes.
- **Build:**
  - A WebSocket server in `/api/socket` to broadcast messages.
  - Send basic messages (e.g., "Hello") between clients.

---

### **🚀 Phase 2: Live Cursors (3–4 Weeks)**

**Goal:** Track and broadcast cursor positions in real-time.

#### **Week 4: Mouse Tracking**

- **Learn:**
  - Track mouse movements with `onMouseMove`.
  - Throttle events to avoid spamming the server.
- **Build:**
  - A component that sends cursor positions (x, y) to the WebSocket server.

#### **Week 5: Presence System**

- **Learn:**
  - Assign unique IDs to users (UUID or session-based).
  - Track "online" users and cleanup disconnected clients.
- **Build:**
  - A list of active users in the document.
  - Show "disconnect" events when users leave.

#### **Week 6: Render Live Cursors**

- **Learn:**
  - Use CSS transforms to position cursors.
  - Smooth animations for cursor movements.
- **Build:**
  - Render other users’ cursors as colored dots/arrows.
  - Add user names/avatars to cursors.

---

### **🚀 Phase 3: Collaborative Text Editing (4–6 Weeks)**

**Goal:** Build a conflict-free collaborative text editor.

#### **Week 7–8: Operational Transformation (OT)**

- **Learn:**
  - **OT theory** (transformations, revision history).
  - Implement basic operations: `insert`, `delete`, `retain`.
- **Build:**
  - A simple OT library to merge text changes.
  - Test conflicts (e.g., two users typing at the same position).

#### **Week 9–10: Integrate OT with WebSockets**

- **Learn:**
  - Send OT operations over WebSockets.
  - Maintain a central server state for the document.
- **Build:**
  - A shared text area where edits sync across clients.
  - Handle undo/redo with OT history.

#### **Week 11–12: Polish & Edge Cases**

- **Learn:**
  - Handle network latency and dropped connections.
  - Resolve merge conflicts gracefully.
- **Build:**
  - Add collaborative cursors (highlight where others are typing).
  - Add version history (roll back to previous states).

---

### **🚀 Phase 4: Authentication & Permissions (2–3 Weeks)**

**Goal:** Secure documents and manage permissions.

#### **Week 13: Authentication**

- **Learn:**
  - **Firebase Auth** or **NextAuth.js** for user sign-in.
  - Store user roles (owner, editor, viewer).
- **Build:**
  - Sign-in with Google/GitHub.
  - Restrict document access to authorized users.

#### **Week 14: Database Integration**

- **Learn:**
  - Use **Firestore** to store document data.
  - Secure data with Firestore rules.
- **Build:**
  - Save documents to Firestore on edits.
  - Load documents from Firestore on page load.

---

### **🔧 Tools You’ll Build From Scratch**

1. **WebSocket Server**: Handle real-time communication.
2. **OT/CRDT Library**: Merge concurrent edits.
3. **Presence System**: Track active users.
4. **Auth System**: User roles and permissions.

### **⚡ Challenges to Expect**

- **OT/CRDT Complexity**: Writing a bug-free merge algorithm will take time.
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Handling 100+ concurrent users requires optimizations.
- **Security**: Preventing malicious edits and unauthorized access.

If you’re ready, let’s start with **Phase 1** and build the WebSocket server in Next.js. I’ll provide detailed code snippets and debugging tips! 🛠️

### **📌 What You Need to Learn to Build Live Cursors & Collaborative Editing in Next.js**

Since this is your **first time working with Next.js**, I'll break it down step by step with **what to learn** and **where you'll use it**.

---

### **🚀 Step 1: Learn Next.js Basics (1 Week)**

📌 **What to Learn:**  
✅ Pages & Routes (`app` or `pages` directory).  
✅ Server Components vs. Client Components (`"use client"` for interactive features).  
✅ API Routes (`/api` folder) for backend logic.

🎯 **Why?**

- You'll use **API routes** to manage real-time communication (WebSockets).
- **Client components** will handle cursor movements & live text updates.

📚 **Where to Learn?**

- [Next.js Official Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- YouTube: _"Next.js 14 Crash Course"_

---

### **🚀 Step 2: Learn WebSockets for Live Cursors (1-2 Weeks)**

📌 **What to Learn:**  
✅ WebSockets (`socket.io` or `WebSockets API`).  
✅ How to send & receive real-time cursor data.  
✅ Store & broadcast user presence (who is online?).

🎯 **Why?**

- You'll use WebSockets to **send cursor positions** to all users in a room.
- Without WebSockets, cursor updates would be **slow** and **not real-time**.

📚 **Where to Learn?**

- [Socket.io Docs](https://socket.io/)
- YouTube: _"Build a WebSocket App in Next.js"_

---

### **🚀 Step 3: Learn Database & Realtime Data Sync (2 Weeks)**

📌 **What to Learn:**  
✅ **Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore** for **automatic syncing**.  
✅ **MongoDB with WebSockets** (if using MongoDB).  
✅ Storing active users & their cursors in the database.

🎯 **Why?**

- Firebase can **automatically sync** user cursors without extra backend setup.
- If using MongoDB, you need **manual WebSocket implementation**.

📚 **Where to Learn?**

- [Firebase Firestore Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [MongoDB Change Streams Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/)

---

### **🚀 Step 4: Learn Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDTs (2-3 Weeks)**

📌 **What to Learn:**  
✅ **Operational Transformation (OT)** (Used in Google Docs).  
✅ **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)** (Used in Notion, Figma).  
✅ How to sync & merge text changes when multiple users edit at the same time.

🎯 **Why?**

- This ensures **smooth** & **conflict-free** text editing.
- Without it, edits will **overwrite each other**, causing **data loss**.

📚 **Where to Learn?**

- [Y.js (CRDT Library)](https://github.com/yjs/yjs)
- YouTube: _"How Google Docs Collaboration Works"_

---

### **🚀 Step 5: Learn UI & State Management (Optional, 1-2 Weeks)**

📌 **What to Learn:**  
✅ **Zustand or Redux** (To store & sync cursor positions).  
✅ **Tailwind CSS** (To design a clean UI).

🎯 **Why?**

- You'll use Zustand/Redux to **store** & **update** real-time user states.
- **Tailwind CSS** will help you **style the collaborative editor**.

📚 **Where to Learn?**

- [Zustand Docs](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand)
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/)
